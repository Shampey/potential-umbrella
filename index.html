  <h2>The Mission</h2>
  <div>

    <!--<h4 style="font-family:Avenir">My project would allow students to access beginning to advanced computer science courses online, completely for free.</h4>-->
    <h4>Teaching students advanced coding, online, for free.</h4>
      
    <p>It would allow them to select what programming language or framework they would like to learn, and learn it. The classes would explain the basics of the programming language, but quickly move on to more advanced topics. It would allow students to create their own projects and share their projects with the community. Sharing these projects would allow the students to learn how others tackle the problems, and could give them valuable knowledge of how to approach a problem. The courses would go into how to resolve errors in your code, and how to build real software. It would give them the skills they need to get good jobs in the future, not just teach them how to write code.

After this idea is in place, the world would have more people that know how to code, but also who know how to work through problems and errors, and how to build real projects. There would be more talented programmers to fill the many emerging computer science jobs. The students would be able to actually secure these jobs because they know how to really create software, rather than knowing only how to write code<!-- in one language-->.</p>

  <h2>Why This Is Important</h2>
  <div>
  <p>In 2020, there were 1.4 million unfilled computer science jobs (daxx.com). The number of computer science graduates in 2020 was only 400,000 (daxx.com). From 2020 to 2030, 660,000 more computer and information technology jobs are projected to appear (bls.gov (1)). 8 of the top 25 jobs in the U.S. favor people with coding knowledge (fastcompany.com). This is going to create a need for more people who know how to write code and understand computers.</p>

  <p>“The overwhelming developer shortage has resulted in the growth of software developer salaries and transformed IT into the best-compensated sector. The median computer programmer salary in the U.S. is more than $100K a year, which in some states is two times larger than the average regional pay.”(daxx.com)</p>
    
    <p>From 2010 to 2019 the number of women computer programmers dropped 2.7%. That might not seem like a lot, but it is (provide evidence pls).</p>
    <!--https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d95/dtab274.asp-->

  <p>“There are too few school graduates ready to pursue tech careers, as only 13.2% of schools offer AP computer science courses. 77% of jobs in the next decade will require tech skills, and educators have already perceived this fact—88% of teachers believe computer sciences are inevitable for students’ future success”.(daxx.com)</p>
    
  <p>There are 18,479 unemployed software developers and designers in the world. That is only 1% of available software design and development jobs (studentscholarships.org, bls.gov (2)). This means that we will need many more trained people to fill these jobs.</p>
    
    <p></p>

  <p>Schools reaching the most diverse populations are less likely to have computer science classes (code.org).</p>
